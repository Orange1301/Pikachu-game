**Introduction:**
Pikachu Puzzle Game (commonly known as Matching Game) includes a board of multiple cells, each of which
presents a figure. The player finds and matches a pair of cells that contain the same figure and connect each other
in some particular pattern. A legal match will make the two cells disappear. The game ends when all matching
pairs are found.
In this project, we developed a simplified version of this Pikachu Puzzle Game by remaking the game with characters
(instead of figures).
